# 🧭 System Design & Backend Engineering Roadmap

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is a **step-by-step learning roadmap for System Design and Backend Engineering**, designed to bridge the gap between **theoretical knowledge** and **real-world implementation**.

Instead of focusing only on diagrams or interview answers, this repository emphasizes **practical understanding through runnable code and real system thinking**.

Each topic is structured in **three clear layers**:

### 1️⃣ Core Fundamentals
- What the concept is  
- Why it exists  
- The problem it solves  

### 2️⃣ System Design Perspective
- How the concept is used in **scalable, reliable systems**
- Design trade-offs and architectural decisions
- Where it fits in real-world architectures  

### 3️⃣ Practical Implementation
- Runnable **Node.js code examples**
- Realistic demos instead of toy examples
- Focus on behavior, failure handling, and performance impact  

> 🎯 The goal is not just to *know* system design, but to **build it, reason about it, and confidently explain real systems**.

## 🎯 Who This Repository Is For

This repository is ideal for:

- 👨‍💻 **Backend developers with 1–5 years of experience**
- 🧠 **Engineers preparing for System Design interviews**
- 🔧 Developers who know theory but want **hands-on clarity**
- 👩‍🏫 **Trainers / mentors** teaching System Design with live demos
- 🚀 Engineers transitioning from **CRUD development to architecture thinking**

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

> “System Design is not about drawing boxes.  
> It’s about understanding trade-offs and implementing them correctly.”

This repository focuses on:
- **Why** a design is chosen  
- **What trade-offs** it introduces  
- **How** it behaves under real-world conditions

## 📌 How to Use This Repository

1. Follow the roadmap **in sequence**
2. Read the fundamentals
3. Understand the design perspective
4. Run the Node.js examples locally
5. Modify configs and observe system behavior
6. Relate concepts to real systems you’ve worked on
